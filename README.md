# Trains by Chris

## Running the Project

### Requirements
- npm
- node

### Setup
`npm install` - Install dependencies

### Run
`npm start` - Run project
`npm test` - Run Mocha test suite

## Assumptions
- Strings provided to distance function will always be formatted properly ('A-B-C'); string validation is not handled by my code
- When counting stops, the final stop (which may be the starting stop) is included
- Provided town names are expected to be valid (eg: 'A', 'B', 'C'; NOT 'Q'), but if they are not a reasonable response will be given (eg: 'no route')
